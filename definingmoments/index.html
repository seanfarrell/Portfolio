	<p>Defining Moments is an Olympic-inspired website that explores key moments in its users lives. Moments of clarity and discovery that shape who we are today. We partnered with some of our own Canadian Olympians to find out their own defining moments, and also accepted submissions from people all across Canada. My role in this project was to create a map-focused responsive design that promoted discovery of stories from all different types of people, as well as the branding for the site.</p>
