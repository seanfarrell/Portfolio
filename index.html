   <p class="desc wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration=".5s" data-wow-delay=".6s">For the launch of iOS8, the team at CBC Radio embarked on their largest and most ambitious digital initiative ever. I was lucky enough to be a part of such an amazing project, the redesign of the CBC Radio iOS applications.

   <p class="desc wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration=".5s" data-wow-delay=".6s">Byron Morgan is a custom putter maker based in Huntington Beach, California. As an avid golfer, I was extremely thrilled to work with him on the redesign of his website. We wanted to give him a website that truly showcased his work, as well as gave his clients a feeling for who Byron was as a person; a laid back ex-surfer from California. He's a gnarly dude who deserved a rad website. I did all of the design and development for this website, which is built with a Wordpress backend.

   <p class="desc wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration=".5s" data-wow-delay=".6s">The 2013 CBC Massey Lectures were delivered by best selling author Lawrence Hill, and were based around his most recent book Blood: The Stuff of Life. To accompany the lectures, we created a beautiful, fully responsive website which took highlights from the book and combined them with various forms of media to create an interactive visual narrative. My role in this project was design and art direction.</p>
