   <p class="desc wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration=".5s" data-wow-delay=".6s">The 2013 CBC Massey Lectures were delivered by best selling author Lawrence Hill, and were based around his most recent book Blood: The Stuff of Life. To accompany the lectures, we created a beautiful, fully responsive website which took highlights from the book and combined them with various forms of media to create an interactive visual narrative. My role in this project was design and art direction.</p>
