  	<p>Since 1936, CBC Radio has been a source of local, national, and international news, documentaries, arts, culture, and current affairs for millions of Canadians.</p>

  	<p>In 2014, a team was put together to reimagine CBC Radio's mobile presence. The primary task was to rebuild the iOS app from the ground up to reflect changes in user behaviour and focus on solid user experience.</p>

  	<p>As the lead designer on this project, I was tasked with planning, conceptualizing, and designing the CBC Radio app in its entirety.</p>
