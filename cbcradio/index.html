  	<p class="centered wow fadeIn">To help out with nested navigation, links pointing to the current directory's, or to a parent directory's index.html file are given the class 'current-parent'. This means that no matter which page you're in, your primary navigation can always have a 'current-parent' class if you're in that folder. For instance, if you're inside docs/info.html, then any links to docs/index.html will have the 'current-parent' class.</p>
