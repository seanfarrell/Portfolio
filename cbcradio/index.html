   <p class="desc wow fadeIn" data-wow-duration=".5s" data-wow-delay=".6s">Byron Morgan is a custom putter maker based in Huntington Beach, California. As an avid golfer, I was extremely thrilled to work with him on the redesign of his website. We wanted to give him a website that truly showcased his work, as well as gave his clients a feeling for who Byron was as a person; a laid back ex-surfer from California. He's a gnarly dude who deserved a rad website. I did all of the design and development for this website, which is built with a Wordpress backend.</p>
