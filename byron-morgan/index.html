	<p>In early 2014, a team was put together to reinvision CBC Radio's mobile presence. Our first objective was to overhaul our iOS apps. We decided a simple redesign of our current app was not enough, we had to go back to the drawing board and reimagine our app from the ground up. Our new app had to give our users everything they had in the old app, and more.</p>

	<p>As the lead designer on this project, I was tasked with planning, conceptualizing, and designing the entire app.</p>
