	<p>Byron Morgan is a custom putter maker based in Huntington Beach, California. As an avid golfer, I was extremely thrilled to work with him on the redesign of his website. We wanted to give him a website that truly showcased his work, as well as gave his clients a feeling for who Byron was as a person; a laid back ex-surfer from California. He's a gnarly dude who deserved a rad website.</p>

	<p>This site was custom designed and developed me, using Wordpress for the backend.</p>
